# 🐕 K9-Ops – Smart Canine Operations Vest

K9-Ops is an **IoT-enabled smart vest for working and search-and-rescue dogs**, designed to improve safety, visibility, and situational awareness during operations in **low-connectivity or no-cellular environments**.

The system integrates **embedded hardware, wireless communication, and sensor monitoring** to provide handlers with real-time insights into the dog’s location, activity, and operational status.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Volunteer Search & Rescue (SAR) teams and working-dog units often operate in **digital dead zones** where cellular-based trackers fail.  
Handlers face a **visual and informational gap**, making it difficult to:
- Track dog location in real time
- Monitor physical exertion or environmental conditions
- Maintain visibility in dark or hazardous environments

K9-Ops addresses these challenges using **low-power, long-range IoT technologies**.
